# RSA Factoring Challenge

This repository contains a program/script that factors natural numbers into a product of two smaller numbers. It was created to fulfill a specific challenge/task.

## Usage

To factorize numbers, run the `factors` executable with a file containing natural numbers to factor. Each number should be on a separate line. The output will show the factorization of each number in the format `n=p*q`.

```bash
./factors <tests/test00>
